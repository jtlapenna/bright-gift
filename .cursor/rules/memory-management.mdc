# Memory Management

- **Remembering…**: At the start of each session, load relevant memory to recall project context.  
- **Reference Memory**: Whenever making design or code decisions, explicitly reference stored knowledge as “memory.”  
- **Update Memory**:
  1. Create or update entities in the knowledge graph (components, modules, files).  
  2. Define relationships (imports, dependencies, hierarchies).  
  3. Store observations about patterns, performance considerations, and architectural decisions.
