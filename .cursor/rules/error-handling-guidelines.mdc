# Error-Handling Guidelines

- Wrap external calls (I/O, network, DB) in try/catch (or `except`).  
- Provide meaningful error messagesâ€”include context and possible causes.  
- Do not swallow errors silently; rethrow or log appropriately.  
- Use domain-specific error types (e.g., `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`).  
- Clean up resources (files, connections) in a `finally` block.
