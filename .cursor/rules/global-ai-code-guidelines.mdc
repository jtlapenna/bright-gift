# Global AI Code-Generation Guidelines

- **Minimalism**: Write as few lines of code as possible.  
- **Commenting**: Label each block with a brief purpose comment.  
- **Clarity**: Use early returns to reduce nesting.  
- **DRY**: Follow best practices and avoid repetition.  
- **Plan First**: Provide step-by-step pseudocode before implementation.  
- **Verify**: Ensure code compiles, runs tests, and is bug-free before finalizing.  
- **Honesty**: If uncertain, explicitly state so rather than hallucinating.  
- **Imports & Naming**: Include all needed imports; name components clearly.  
- **Modularity**: Break large tasks into smaller, testable chunks.  
- **Brevity**: Be conciseâ€”minimize unnecessary prose.
