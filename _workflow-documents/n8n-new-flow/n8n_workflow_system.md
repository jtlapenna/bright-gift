# üìò n8n Workflow System Overview

## üîπ Summary

This system automates the end-to-end creation, optimization, and publishing of SEO-optimized blog posts using specialized n8n workflows. A web-based control dashboard allows human-in-the-loop oversight (optionally only at the beginning and end), while n8n orchestrates workflow execution, state syncing, and dashboard updates. The system is modular, version-controlled, and designed for scalability across multiple sites.
