# üìä Analytics Schema Plan: n8n Workflow System

This document outlines the foundational analytics we will use to track content performance, workflow efficiency, and user engagement across the multi-site platform.

---

## üéØ Goals
- Measure content effectiveness (SEO + engagement) across all sites
- Evaluate workflow efficiency and performance across phases
- Monitor user interaction with dashboard tools and approval workflows
- Optimize content strategy and workflow performance based on actual outcomes
- Track multi-site performance and cross-site analytics

---

## üìà Metrics to Track

### üîç SEO + Content Metrics
- Page views per blog post (per site)
- Unique visitors and geographic distribution
- Time on page and scroll depth
- Bounce rate and exit pages
- Keyword rankings (via external SEO API or search console import)
- Indexed status and crawl frequency
- Internal clickthroughs to other posts
- Organic search traffic and CTR

### üîó Affiliate Performance
- Clicks on affiliate links (per blog post, per product, per site)
- Outbound link destinations and conversion tracking
- Estimated earnings or conversions per product (via affiliate platform API)
- Conversion proxy (click + high dwell time or return visits)
- Affiliate link performance by site and content type

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Efficiency Metrics
- Workflow runtime per phase (SEO_RESEARCH, CONTENT_GENERATION, etc.)
- Number of retries or errors per workflow phase
- Time between workflow trigger and completion
- Workflow completion state (success/failure/partial)
- Phase transition efficiency and bottlenecks
- Resource utilization during workflow execution

### üë• User Interaction Metrics
- User actions on dashboard (clicks, approvals, rejections, edits)
- Number of blogs initiated vs completed per user
- Number of approvals and rejections per user
- Number of edits requested and types of changes
- Dashboard usage patterns and feature adoption
- User workflow preferences and optimization patterns

### üì± Social Post Metrics
- Social posts generated per platform and site
- Clickthroughs from social posts (if tracked)
- Social engagement rates and reach
- Cross-platform performance comparison
- Social content performance by content type

### üåê Multi-Site Performance
- Performance comparison across all sites
- Site-specific workflow efficiency
- Cross-site content performance patterns
- Site-specific user engagement metrics
- Resource allocation and optimization per site
