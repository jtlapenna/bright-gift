## 💡 Tips for n8n Workflows

- Always check for a `workflow_state.json` file when working on blog generation.
- Use file paths and commit messages consistently (see `blog_file_structure_and_state_format.md`).
- When done with your task, write a new `workflow_state.json`, commit it, and trigger the next workflow via webhook.
- Refer to the dashboard sync flow if you're responsible for updating state info post-task.
- Use webhook authentication for secure workflow handoffs.

---

## 🌱 Extending the System
- You can add new workflows by duplicating existing ones and updating routing logic.
- n8n flows can be cloned and modified with new webhook triggers.
- Supabase and dashboard are extensible with minimal code changes.
- Workflow templates can be customized for different content types.

## 🚀 **Clean Slate Implementation**

### **Recommended Approach: New Repository**
For the cleanest implementation, create a new repository:

```bash
# Create new repository
git clone https://github.com/jtlapenna/blog-automation.git n8n-workflow-system
cd n8n-workflow-system

# Remove old project files
rm -rf content-automation-export-v2/
rm -rf approval-hub/  # (we have it in template now)

# Copy template to root level
cp -r template/* .
rm -rf template/

# Initialize new git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: n8n workflow automation system"
```

### **What's Included in the Clean Template:**
- ✅ **All reusable utility files** from audit findings
- ✅ **Complete CLI system** with 12 commands
- ✅ **Web-based approval hub** (React + Cloudflare Pages)
- ✅ **Workflow configurations** for all 6 workflows
- ✅ **Database schema** and configuration
- ✅ **n8n workflows** and environment setup
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** and update guides

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Phase 2**: Update ported files for new architecture (see `files-requiring-updates.md`)
2. **Phase 3**: Set up Supabase and n8n infrastructure
3. **Phase 4**: Build and test workflow system
4. **Phase 5**: Deploy dashboard and production system
