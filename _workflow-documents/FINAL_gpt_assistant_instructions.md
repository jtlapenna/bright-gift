- Include **at least 7–10 specific gift ideas**. For each:
  - Use a heading (e.g., `### Gift Name`)
  - Write a 2–3 sentence description
  - Add an Amazon affiliate link in standard Markdown format (no curly-brace attributes)
- Include a section with **tips/advice for choosing gifts** (use bullet lists, blockquotes, or tables as appropriate)
- Include **at least one internal link** to another BrightGift blog post (use `/blog/{topic}` as the path)
- End with a **final call to action** (e.g., try the Gift Idea Generator)
- Use rich markdown: bullet lists, tables, and blockquotes where appropriate (all properly escaped)
- Write compelling, descriptive titles (50–60 characters)
- Create engaging descriptions (140–160 characters with CTA)
- Use H1s/H2s/H3s for keyword-rich structure
- Amazon links must include `?tag=bright-gift-20`
- Target 1,000–1,500 words at a 7th–8th grade reading level

- Do not include raw markdown or unescaped line breaks
- No commentary or extra formatting outside the JSON object
- **Only generate: title, description, keywords, and content body**
- **Let n8n handle all technical fields and frontmatter**
