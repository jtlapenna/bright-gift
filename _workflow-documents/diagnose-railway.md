# Railway Deployment Diagnosis Guide

## üö® Current Issue
- All endpoints returning 502 errors or timeouts
- Service not responding to any requests
- Multiple configuration attempts unsuccessful

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Railway Project Settings
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your `brightgift-puppeteer` project
3. Check the following:

#### Project Configuration
- **Service Type**: Should be "Web Service"
- **Environment**: Should be "Production"
- **Region**: Check if it's in a supported region

#### Build Settings
- **Build Command**: Should be empty (using default)
- **Start Command**: Should be `node test-server.js` (current)
- **Health Check Path**: Should be `/health`

#### Environment Variables
- **PORT**: Should be automatically set by Railway
- **NODE_ENV**: Should be `production`

### 2. Check Railway Logs
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service
2. Click on "Logs" tab
3. Look for:
   - Build logs (should show npm install)
   - Runtime logs (should show server startup)
   - Error messages or crashes

### 3. Verify Repository Connection
1. Check if Railway is connected to the correct GitHub repository
2. Verify the branch is `main`
3. Check if automatic deployments are enabled

### 4. Test Different Approaches

#### Option A: Use Railway CLI (if available)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and check status
railway login
railway status
railway logs
```

#### Option B: Manual Railway Configuration
1. In Railway dashboard, try:
   - **Redeploy**: Force a fresh deployment
   - **Restart**: Restart the service
   - **Rebuild**: Rebuild from scratch

#### Option C: Alternative Deployment
Consider using:
- **Render**: Alternative to Railway
- **Heroku**: More established platform
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Good for Node.js apps

## üõ†Ô∏è Potential Solutions

### If Basic Node.js Works
1. **Add Puppeteer back gradually**:
   - Start with basic Puppeteer (no Chromium)
   - Add Chromium dependencies one by one
   - Test each step

### If Basic Node.js Fails
1. **Check Railway account status**:
   - Verify account is active
   - Check usage limits
   - Ensure project is not suspended

2. **Try different Railway settings**:
   - Different regions
   - Different service types
   - Manual deployment triggers

3. **Consider platform migration**:
   - Move to Render or Heroku
   - Use Docker containers
   - Deploy to VPS

## üìä Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Expected (Working)
```
[STARTUP] Starting test server...
[STARTUP] Environment: production
[STARTUP] Port: 3000
[STARTUP] Test server running on port 3000
[STARTUP] Memory usage: 45MB
[STARTUP] Server started successfully
```

### Actual (Current Issue)
- No startup logs visible
- Service not responding
- 502 errors from Railway edge

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Check Railway dashboard logs** for any error messages
2. **Verify project configuration** in Railway settings
3. **Try manual redeploy** from Railway dashboard
4. **Consider alternative deployment platform** if issues persist
