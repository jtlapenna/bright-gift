## üß† Workflow Overview

### Phase 1: Idea Generation
- üß© **Trigger**: Weekly or on-demand (via CLI or n8n)
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Prompt**: GPT agent generates 3 blog ideas using Jeff‚Äôs style guide and predefined content categories:
  - Mainstream (e.g. trending topics)
  - Alternative/subculture (e.g. niche/identity-driven gifting)
  - Cutting-edge (e.g. AI-generated gifts, NFTs, etc.)
- üì§ **Output**: Markdown file (or JSON) with:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Target keywords
  - Suggested product category
- üîÅ **Delivery**: Sent to Jeff via email or saved to GitHub Issues/Inbox for review

### Phase 2: Approval & Notes
- Jeff selects one idea and optionally adds notes (via email reply, GitHub comment, or n8n UI form)

### Phase 3: Draft Generation
- GPT agent writes:
  - SEO-optimized blog post (~1,000‚Äì1,500 words)
  - Includes affiliate-linked products (using your tag)
  - Includes 2 high-quality external links (non-competitor sources)
  - Includes 2 relevant images (web-sourced or AI-generated if needed)
- Output is a full Markdown file with:
  - Meta title/description
  - H1‚ÄìH3 sections
  - Affiliate product cards (using preformatted components or shortcodes)

### Phase 4: Visual Preview
- Draft saved to GitHub in `/drafts` branch
- Auto-deployed preview via Cloudflare Pages (or Vercel) with custom preview domain
- Jeff receives a link to review

### Phase 5: Approval & Publishing
- Upon approval (via checkbox toggle or comment command):
  - Merge to `main` or `live` branch
  - Trigger Cloudflare build to publish live post
  - Trigger SEO task (e.g., sitemap update, internal link scan)

### Phase 6: Post-Publish Marketing
- GPT drafts:
  - Short social media posts (X, Instagram, Threads)
  - Email summary for newsletter (Mailchimp, Buttondown, or ConvertKit)
- Posts or email saved as Markdown, HTML, or scheduled via n8n

## üîó Linking Requirement

Each blog post must include a clear and prominent link back to the BrightGift AI Gift Generator tool:

**URL:** https://bright-gift.com

This supports internal SEO and encourages users to engage with the main tool.

## üß© Future Considerations
- Add GA4/Clarity/Hotjar for analytics
- Add OpenGraph image generation for blog cards
- Add Zapier or IFTTT for backup social triggers
- Support voice or mobile prompts for idea approval (via email or Telegram bot)
