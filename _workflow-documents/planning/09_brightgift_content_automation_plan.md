## üß† Automated Workflow Overview

### Phase 1: Automated Idea Generation & Email Delivery
- üß© **Trigger**: Weekly cron job (n8n) or manual trigger
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Process**: 
  1. n8n calls **Idea Generator Agent** via OpenAI API
  2. Agent generates 3 ideas using style guide + priority categories
  3. n8n formats ideas into email template
  4. Email sent to Jeff via Gmail API
- üì§ **Email Content**:
  - Subject: "üéÅ New Blog Ideas for BrightGift - [Date]"
  - Body: 3 formatted ideas with titles, descriptions, keywords
  - Reply options: "Select Idea 1", "Select Idea 2", "Select Idea 3", "Generate More"
- üîÅ **Delivery**: Automated email sent to Jeff's inbox

### Priority Content Categories

> **NOTE**: A "Top 10 Gifts" hub page has been created but is currently hidden from navigation. When generating content ideas, prioritize creating articles for the following categories to enable the hub page:
> - Top 10 Gifts for Coffee Lovers
> - Top 10 Gifts for Plant Parents
> - Top 10 Tech Gifts Under $50
> - Top 10 Gifts for Coworkers

## üö¶ Improvements for Robustness, SEO, and Automation

### 1. Content Clustering & Interlinking
- **Content clusters** (e.g., "Budget Gifts", "Eco-Friendly Gifts", "Occasion-Based Gifts") will be defined and maintained.
- **Idea Generator Agent** and **Blog Writer Agent** will:
  - Assign each post to a cluster.
  - Suggest 2‚Äì3 internal links to related posts in the same cluster.
  - Maintain a cluster map for future interlinking.
- **Workflow:** n8n will update and reference the cluster map for every new post, and prompt agents to recommend internal links.

### 2. Fallback/Retry Logic for Approvals
- If Jeff does not respond to an idea or draft within X days:
  - n8n sends up to N reminder emails.
  - After N reminders, workflow auto-pauses or escalates (e.g., sends a Slack/Telegram alert, or skips to the next idea).
- **Workflow:** All approval steps in n8n include retry and escalation logic to prevent stuck workflows.

### 3. Media Asset Handling Fallbacks
- If affiliate product images are missing or fail to generate:
  - Use a default illustrated placeholder or a generic icon for the category.
  - Log the missing asset for manual review.
- **Blog Writer Agent** and **Image Generator Agent** will include fallback instructions in their prompts.

### 4. Analytics Feedback Loop
- n8n (or a scheduled script) will pull top-performing and underperforming posts from Google Search Console and analytics.
- This data will:
  - Prioritize updates for low performers.
  - Suggest new topics based on high performers.
  - Feed performance data into the Idea Generator Agent's prompt for smarter topic selection.
- **Workflow:** Analytics review and feedback will be a recurring task in the automation schedule.

### 5. Error Handling & Logging
- All agents and n8n flows will:
  - Log errors with context (step, input, error message).
  - Retry failed steps up to N times.
  - If still failing, send an alert and provide a fallback (e.g., skip, use placeholder, or pause workflow).
- **Workflow:** Error logs will be reviewed regularly, and fallback responses will be documented for transparency and improvement.

---

## üß† GPT Agent Prompt Addenda (for Robustness)

**For all agents:**
- If you encounter a missing asset, unavailable data, or an error, log the issue and use a fallback (e.g., placeholder image, generic link, or skip the item).
- If internal links or clusters are not available, recommend the most relevant existing content or omit the section with a log entry.
- Always provide clear error messages and context in logs for any failed step.

**For Idea Generator Agent:**
- Reference the latest analytics and cluster map to prioritize topics.
- Suggest internal links to related posts in the same cluster.

**For Blog Writer Agent:**
- Assign the post to a content cluster and include 2‚Äì3 internal links to related posts.
- If product images are missing, use a default placeholder and log the issue.

**For Image Generator Agent:**
- If DALL-E 3 fails or is unavailable, use a generic category icon and log the fallback.

**For Social Media Agent:**
- If a platform API fails, retry up to N times, then log and skip that platform for the current post.

---

**Memory:** The automation plan now includes content clustering, fallback/approval logic, media asset fallbacks, analytics feedback, and robust error handling/logging. All agents and workflows are instructed to use these mechanisms for resilience, SEO, and continuous improvement.
