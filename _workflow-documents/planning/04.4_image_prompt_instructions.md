## üé® BrightGift Image Style (Required in Every Prompt)

Every prompt must match the BrightGift brand's whimsical and editorial image tone ‚Äî a mix of playful 3D-style cartoon objects and subtle 2D illustrative elements.

At the end of every prompt, include this BrightGift Style Signature, word for word:

**"Modern flat illustration with soft 3D-style characters and objects, combined with subtle 2D decorative elements. Use warm, vibrant pastels (teal #00A99D, coral-orange #FF6B35, sunshine yellow #FFD700). Layout must be clean and giftable, using rounded forms, balanced negative space, and minimal visual clutter. The tone should feel cheerful, light, editorial, and creative ‚Äî never realistic or photorealistic. Use text only in social images."**

‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT paraphrase, reword, or reference bright-gift.com as a style shortcut.
