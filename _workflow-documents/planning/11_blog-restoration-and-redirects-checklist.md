## 2. Update Internal Links
- Change all `/gift-guides/...` links to `/blog/...` equivalents in all content.

---

## 3. Add 301 Redirects for Legacy URLs
Add to your `_redirects` file (e.g., `public/_redirects`):
```
/gift-guides/gifts-for-gamers-under-50/   /blog/gifts-for-gamers-under-50/   301
/gift-guides/gifts-under-25-for-coworkers/   /blog/gifts-under-25-for-coworkers/   301
/gift-guides/gifts-for-plant-lovers/   /blog/gifts-for-plant-lovers/   301
```

---

## 4. Check ImageKit Origin (if using ImageKit)
- Set origin to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/<branch>/`
- Purge cache for moved/renamed images.

---

## 5. Rebuild and Redeploy
- Rebuild and redeploy the site.
- Confirm:
  - Restored blog posts are live
  - Old `/gift-guides/` URLs redirect to `/blog/`
  - Internal links are correct
  - Images load as expected

---

## 6. Monitor Google Search Console
- Watch for reduction in 404s
- Validate fixed redirects
- Request reindexing if needed

---

## 7. (Optional) Remove Old Sitemap Entries
- Ensure sitemap only includes live URLs (no `/gift-guides/`)

---

## 8. (Optional) Protect Main Branch
- Prevent automations from force-pushing to `main` unless intended
