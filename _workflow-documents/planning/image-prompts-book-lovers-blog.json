Include items like cozy blankets, book-themed candles, personalized bookmarks, reading lights, and book stands. Books are stacked and arranged with reading accessories scattered around them. Add floating sparkles and decorative elements to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Modern flat illustration with soft 3D-style characters and objects, combined with subtle 2D decorative elements. Use warm, vibrant pastels (teal #00A99D, coral-orange #FF6B35, sunshine yellow #FFD700). Layout must be clean and giftable, using rounded forms, balanced negative space, and minimal visual clutter. The tone should feel cheerful, light, editorial, and creative — never realistic or photorealistic. Use text only in social images."
