Books are stacked in neat piles and arranged in a flat-lay composition with subtle 3D-style depth. Include floating sparkles and decorative elements around the books. Modern flat illustration with soft 3D-style characters and objects, combined with subtle 2D decorative elements. Use warm, vibrant pastels (teal #00A99D, coral-orange #FF6B35, sunshine yellow #FFD700). Layout must be clean and giftable, using rounded forms, balanced negative space, and minimal visual clutter. The tone should feel cheerful, light, editorial, and creative — never realistic or photorealistic. Use text only in social images."
