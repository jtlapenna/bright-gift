## ðŸ§© Prompt Construction Logic

### ðŸ”¹ Inputs Collected from User:
- Recipient description (e.g. "my 29-year-old sister who loves yoga and books")
- Interests or hobbies (freeform)
- Budget range
- Optional style preference (e.g. handmade, funny, eco-friendly)

### ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Prompt Formula:
```
"Suggest [6â€“9] [style preference] gift ideas for [recipient description]. 
They enjoy [interests]. Budget is under [$X]. 
Each gift should include a title, a short description, and a product category tag. Style should be reflected in the tone and ideas."
```

### ðŸ”¹ Example Prompt:
```
Suggest 8 handmade gift ideas for a 40-year-old dad who loves cooking and hiking. 
Keep each under $50. Focus on artisan, outdoorsy, and kitchen-themed items. 
Return in markdown format with title, short description, and product tag. Style should be prominent in the ideas and tone.
```

## ðŸ“¤ Prompt Management

| Layer            | Approach                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Default prompt   | Defined in code with template tokens           |
| Prompt testing   | Weekly review + A/B tests of style impact      |
| Edge cases       | Prompt trims extra input or asks for clarity   |
| Prompt count     | Now requests 6â€“9 ideas per user request       |

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Progress Notes
- Updated prompt logic to request 6â€“9 ideas and make style prominent in both ideas and tone. Prompt builder will be updated accordingly.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Error & Edge Handling

- If output is too short: re-run with slight rephrase
- If user enters unclear input: AI returns clarification question
- Timeout/failover: show default gift ideas based on trending keywords

---

## ðŸ§ª Prompt QA Strategy

- Weekly prompt-response QA sample (10 outputs)
- Check for tone, length, link match accuracy, and diversity
- Maintain prompt version control (v1, v2, etc.)

---

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- Prompt memory: let user "refine" previous output
- Personality/MBTI-based prompts
- Occasion-specific prompt variants (wedding, retirement, etc.)
