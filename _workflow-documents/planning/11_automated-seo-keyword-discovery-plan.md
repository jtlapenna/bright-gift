# Automated SEO Long-Tail Keyword Discovery Plan (Detailed)

## Overview
A fully automated workflow to discover high-potential, low-competition long-tail SEO keywords for new blog posts, leveraging your stack (Cursor, n8n, Railway, Cloudflare). This plan covers technical steps, data flow, error handling, and integration details for robust, scalable automation.

---

## Workflow Summary (Expanded)

### 1. SEO Assistant: Topic Audit & Seed Generation
- **Crawl/Read Blog Content:**
  - Use n8n HTTP Request or custom Node.js script to fetch all published blog post slugs, titles, meta descriptions, and tags from your content repo or live site.
  - Parse Markdown frontmatter or HTML to extract topics/keywords.
  - Store results in a database (e.g., Railway Postgres) or in-memory for the session.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Retry failed fetches.
    - Log missing/invalid metadata.
    - Alert if no posts found.
- **Generate New Seed Topics:**
  - Use OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4) with a prompt like:
    > "Given these existing blog topics: [list], suggest 20 new, diverse, high-potential gift guide topics not yet covered. Focus on unique audiences, occasions, or trends."
  - Optionally enrich with:
    - Google Trends API (fetch trending queries in the gift/shopping space).
    - Competitor site crawl (extract their top categories/posts).
    - Reddit/Quora scraping for frequently asked questions.
  - **Deduplication:**
    - Fuzzy match new ideas against existing topics to avoid overlap.
    - Use string similarity (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or embedding-based comparison.
  - **Edge Cases:**
    - If no new topics are found, fallback to trending or seasonal ideas.
    - If OpenAI returns generic topics, re-prompt for more specificity.

### 2. Long-Tail Keyword Discovery
- **For Each Seed Topic:**
  - Use OpenAI to expand each topic into 10–20 long-tail keyword ideas.
    > "For the topic '[seed]', list 15 long-tail, buyer-intent search queries a user might Google."
  - For each keyword:
    - Query a keyword API (Ubersuggest, SEMrush, SerpAPI, or Google Keyword Planner) for:
      - Search volume
      - Competition/difficulty score
      - CPC (optional)
    - Scrape Google SERP (Puppeteer/Playwright or SerpAPI):
      - Count number of forums, Quora, Reddit, and low-authority sites in top 10.
      - Check for presence of big brands or highly optimized content.
      - Optionally, extract "People also ask" and "Related searches" for further expansion.
  - **Data Storage:**
    - Store all keyword ideas and metrics in a database or as a CSV/JSON for review.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Handle API rate limits (backoff/retry).
    - Log and skip keywords with missing data.
    - Alert if all API calls fail.
  - **Edge Cases:**
    - If no volume data, flag as "zero-volume" but keep if intent is strong.
    - If all keywords are high competition, prompt OpenAI for even more specific queries.

### 3. AI Selection of Best Ideas
- **Scoring & Ranking:**
  - For each keyword, compute a score:
    - Score = (Search Volume * Intent Weight) / (Competition + Brand Presence)
    - Intent Weight: +2x for buyer/transactional queries, +1x for informational.
    - Brand Presence: +1 for each big brand in top 10, -1 for each forum/Reddit.
  - Use OpenAI to review the top 10–20 scored keywords and select the 3–5 with the highest potential:
    > "Given this list of keywords with metrics, pick the 5 most likely to bring early organic traffic to a new blog."
  - Optionally, add a manual review step (Cloudflare dashboard) for override.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - If all scores are low, prompt OpenAI to suggest alternative angles or sub-niches.
    - Log all scoring decisions for transparency.

### 4. Email Notification
- **Compose Email:**
  - Format the top keyword ideas, their metrics, and suggested content angles in a clear, actionable email.
  - Include a summary table:
    | Keyword | Volume | Competition | Score | Suggested Title |
    |---------|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|
  - Use n8n’s email node to send to your address.
  - **Reply Handling:**
    - n8n monitors the inbox for your reply (using IMAP/POP3 node or webhook).
    - Extract your chosen keyword/topic from the reply.
    - Trigger the next step in the automation.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Retry email send on failure.
    - Alert if no reply is received within X days.

### 5. Content Generation
- **Trigger Existing Assistant:**
  - Pass the selected keyword/topic to your current content assistant workflow (via webhook, API, or direct integration).
  - Ensure all context (metrics, suggested angles) is included in the payload.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Log and alert on failed content generation.
    - Retry or escalate as needed.
