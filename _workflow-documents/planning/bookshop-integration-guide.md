}

} else if (/book|reading|literature|novel|author|fiction|nonfiction|poetry|magazine|journal/i.test(tag) || /book|reading|literature|novel|author|fiction|nonfiction|poetry|magazine|journal/i.test(title)) {
  // Bookshop.org for book-related items
  link = generateBookshopLink(title, bookshopAffiliateId);
  const icon = 'Book';
  ideas.push({ title, description, tag, link, icon });
}
```
