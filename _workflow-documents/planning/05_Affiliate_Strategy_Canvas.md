## üõ† Link Insertion Logic

### AI Tool Output:
- Each suggestion includes:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Affiliate link (with rel="nofollow" + target="_blank")
  - Optional "View on [Retailer]" label
- Link is generated based on keyword + style match (e.g. "handmade tea cup" ‚Üí Etsy)

### Blog Posts:
- Inline product links in gift list items
- Bonus CTA blocks (e.g. "Still not sure? Try the AI Gift Generator")
- Links open in new tabs
- Optional button format for better CTR

### Implementation Notes (2024-07-27)
- Etsy: Use Etsy API with OAuth2 token to fetch real product links and images for AI-generated gift ideas with 'Handmade' or similar style. Display the first product's image and link in the card.
- Amazon: Use search URLs with keywords for now; upgrade to Product Advertising API when eligible. No product images for Amazon search fallback yet.
- All cards: Always display a product image if available from the affiliate source (Etsy, etc.).
- Fallback: If no direct product match, use the first result from the search for both link and image.

### Issues & Next Steps (2024-07-27)
- [ ] Product images are broken (likely invalid or missing URLs from affiliate sources).
- [ ] Handmade/Etsy style does not return Etsy links or products‚Äîverify Etsy API integration and token.
- [ ] Card layout: Make cards wider and less tall for better UX.
- [ ] Next: Fix image URLs, debug/fix Etsy integration, and improve card layout.
