## ü§ñ AI Gift Generator Integration

### **Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**What's Been Added:**
1. **New Style Options**: 
   - ‚úÖ "Black-owned" style preference (replaces "cultural-gifts")
   - ‚úÖ "Wellness" style preference
   - ‚úÖ "Athletics" style preference  
   - ‚úÖ "Beauty" style preference
2. **Smart Afrofiliate Routing**: AI prioritizes Afrofiliate brands in ALL relevant searches
3. **Intelligent Fallback Logic**: Handles cases when no Afrofiliate brands match

**How It Works:**
1. **Always Check Afrofiliate First**: Every search checks for Afrofiliate brand matches, regardless of style selection
2. **Style-Specific Routing**: 
   - "Black-owned" style ‚Üí Prioritizes Afrofiliate brands, with fallback to Amazon + disclaimer
   - "Beauty" style ‚Üí Can suggest BeautyStat/Kadalys skincare + Amazon beauty products
   - "Athletics" style ‚Üí Can suggest Furi Sport/Be Yourself 314 athletic wear + Amazon sports products
   - "Wellness" style ‚Üí Can suggest Endorf supplements + Amazon wellness products
3. **Fallback Behavior**: 
   - If no Afrofiliate brands match ‚Üí Amazon links with appropriate disclaimers
   - If "Black-owned" style selected but no matches ‚Üí Suggests Afrofiliate brand websites

**AI Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ **Can suggest specific products** from Afrofiliate brands when the AI knows about them
- ‚úÖ **Can suggest brand categories** (e.g., "skincare from Black-owned businesses")
- ‚úÖ **Integrates with all style preferences** - Afrofiliate brands appear in beauty, athletics, wellness searches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited to known brands** - AI won't suggest products from brands not in your affiliate program

## üé® Link Suggestion Card Display

### **Visual Design:**
- **Icons Only**: Afrofiliate links use product-specific icons (not generic sparkle)
- **No Product Images**: Consistent with Amazon links which also use icons
- **Card Layout**: Same responsive design as Amazon/Bookshop cards
- **Button Text**: "Shop [Brand Name]" instead of "View on Amazon"

### **Icon System:**
- **Afrofiliate Links**: Product-specific icons:
  - BeautyStat/Kadalys ‚Üí Sparkle icon (‚ú®)
  - Furi Sport/Be Yourself 314 ‚Üí SoccerBall icon (‚öΩ)
  - Be Rooted ‚Üí Note icon (üìù)
  - Endorf ‚Üí Heartbeat icon (‚ù§Ô∏è)
  - Caribe Coffee ‚Üí CookingPot icon (üç≥)
- **Amazon Links**: Category-specific icons (Book, TShirt, House, etc.)
- **Bookshop Links**: Book icon
- **Fallback**: Gift icon for error states

- **Coffee searches** ‚Üí Can suggest Caribe Coffee
- **Stationery searches** ‚Üí Can suggest Be Rooted products

### **Fallback Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 2: Black-Owned Style Selected, No Matches**
- **Behavior**: Suggest Afrofiliate brand websites directly
- **Fallback Options**: BeautyStat, Furi Sport, Caribe Coffee, etc.
- **Message**: "While we couldn't find specific products matching your search, here are some amazing Black-owned brands to explore:"

#### **Scenario 3: Mixed Results**
