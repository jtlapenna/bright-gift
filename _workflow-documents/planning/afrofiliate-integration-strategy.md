## ü§ñ AI Gift Generator Integration

### **Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**What's Been Added:**
1. **New Style Option**: "Black-owned" style preference
2. **Afrofiliate Routing Logic**: AI can now suggest products from Black-owned businesses
3. **Smart Brand Matching**: System matches product suggestions to appropriate Afrofiliate brands

**How It Works:**
- When users select "Black-owned" style, the AI prioritizes products from your Afrofiliate brands
- The system matches product categories (skincare, athletic wear, etc.) to appropriate brands
- If no direct match is found, it falls back to Amazon with Black-owned business suggestions

**AI Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ **Can suggest specific products** from Afrofiliate brands when the AI knows about them
- ‚úÖ **Can suggest brand categories** (e.g., "skincare from Black-owned businesses")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited to known brands** - AI won't suggest products from brands not in your affiliate program
