      "text": "A wide horizontal scene showing interconnected 3D-style hearts floating in a gentle network pattern, with subtle neural pathway lines connecting them, surrounded by soft geometric shapes representing brain regions and social bonds. The hearts are arranged in a flowing, organic layout with some overlapping and some floating freely, creating a sense of community and connection. Include small sparkles and gentle motion lines around the hearts to suggest the energy of human connection. 16:9 aspect ratio, 1200px wide. Modern flat illustration with soft 3D-style characters and objects, combined with subtle 2D decorative elements. Use warm, vibrant pastels (teal #00A99D, coral-orange #FF6B35, sunshine yellow #FFD700). Layout must be clean and giftable, using rounded forms, balanced negative space, and minimal visual clutter. The tone should feel cheerful, light, editorial, and creative — never realistic or photorealistic. Use text only in social images. Background colors can vary within our color palette."

The hands are positioned to suggest unity and support, with gentle connecting lines between them. Include small heart shapes and sparkles scattered throughout to emphasize the emotional aspect of human connection. 16:9 aspect ratio, 1200px wide.
