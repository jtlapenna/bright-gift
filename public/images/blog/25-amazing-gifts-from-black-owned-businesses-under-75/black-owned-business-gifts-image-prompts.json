      "text": "A wide horizontal flat-lay composition featuring an elegant assortment of gift items representing Black-owned businesses: skincare bottles with golden serums, athletic wear in vibrant colors, wellness supplements in modern packaging, and stationery items with mindful designs. The scene includes floating sparkles and decorative elements around the gifts, arranged in a balanced cluster with plenty of negative space. Dimension ratio 16:9, size 1200px wide. Modern flat illustration with soft 3D-style characters and objects, combined with subtle 2D decorative elements. Use warm, vibrant pastels (teal #00A99D, coral-orange #FF6B35, sunshine yellow #FFD700). Layout must be clean and giftable, using rounded forms, balanced negative space, and minimal visual clutter. The tone should feel cheerful, light, editorial, and creative — never realistic or photorealistic. Use text only in social images. Background colors can vary within our color palette."
