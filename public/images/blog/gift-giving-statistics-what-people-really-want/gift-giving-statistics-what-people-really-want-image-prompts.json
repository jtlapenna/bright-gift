Include floating percentage symbols, dollar signs, and small gift icons scattered throughout. Use a mix of 3D-style gift boxes in various sizes and 2D chart elements with bright, engaging colors. The composition should feel data-driven yet warm and gift-focused. 16:9 ratio, 1200px wide. Modern flat illustration with soft 3D-style characters and objects, combined with subtle 2D decorative elements. Use warm, vibrant pastels (teal #00A99D, coral-orange #FF6B35, sunshine yellow #FFD700). Layout must be clean and giftable, using rounded forms, balanced negative space, and minimal visual clutter. The tone should feel cheerful, light, editorial, and creative — never realistic or photorealistic. Use text only in social images. Background colors can vary within our color palette."
